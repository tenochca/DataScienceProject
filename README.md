# DataScienceProject
Final Project for my fundamentals of data science class. Using google collab I trained and tested 3 different machine learning models on a diabetes prediction dataset.

Hyperparameters in the code are left at the final values I chose during tuning as designated in the report

I plan to imporve these models by adding a validation set and fixing the class inbalance problem.
